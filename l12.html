            <p class="lead px-5">
                I think drawing is the best hobby. 
                You can create art anywhere as long as you have two things: pencils and paper. 
                It's good to start at a young age because it gives you a chance to start using your 
                brain and to be creative. Also, it is an opportunity to challenge thinking skills and 
                develop learning skills.
                A sketch, is a rapidly executed freehand drawing that is not usually intended as a 
                finished work. A sketch may serve a number of purposes: it might record something that
                the artist sees, it might record or develop an idea for later use or it might be used as
                a quick way of graphically demonstrating an image, idea or principle. Sketching is the most
                inexpensive art medium

            <h2 class="diplay-3 pb-3 px-5">Creative Writing</h2>
            <p class="lead px-5">
                Creative writing is any writing that goes outside the bounds of normal professional, 
                journalistic, academic, or technical forms of literature, typically identified by an 
                emphasis on narrative craft, character development, and the use of literary tropes or 
                with various traditions of poetry and poetics. Due to the looseness of the definition, 
                it is possible for writing such as feature stories to be considered creative writing, 
                even though they fall under journalism, because the content of features is specifically 
                focused on narrative and character development. Both fictional and non-fictional works 
                fall into this category, including such forms as novels, biographies, short stories, and 
                poems. In the academic setting, creative writing is typically separated into fiction and 
                poetry classes, with a focus on writing in an original style, as opposed to imitating 
                pre-existing genres such as crime or horror. Writing for the screen and stage—screenwriting 
                and playwriting—are often taught separately, but fit under the creative writing category as 
                well.

            <h2 class="diplay-3 pb-3 px-5">Gardening</h2>
            <p class="lead px-5">
                Gardening may be a fun and relaxing way to get in touch with nature, but did you know that
                it also has plenty of health benefits? Gardening is an activity that’s good for both the mind
                and body, and can be enjoyed by people of all ages. Plus, you get to eat the delicious fruits,
                vegetables and herbs that you grow. So, grab your tools and get in the dirt!
                You may not think of gardening as exercise, but all the lifting, shoveling and raking involved
                definitely counts, says Raychel Santo, MA, senior research program coordinator for the Center 
                for a Livable Future at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health
